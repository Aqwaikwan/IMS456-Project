		<h1>Day of My Life During MCO Day</h1>
	</center>
	<center>
		<p>This MCO started from 18th March 2020 where the goverment decided to issued an order where all citizen to stay at their home due to the pandemic problem that happen around the world.</p>
		<p>This pandemic problem was about the corona virus also know as COVID-19 that has spreaded around the world and have killed hundred of thousand people.<br>
		So to break the chain of this dangerous virus from spreading, the goverment ordered all citizen to stay in their<br>
		home and conduct the sosial distancing. For us that stay at home, it would be hard because maybe some of us can't enjoy and having fun to go out side<br>
		but we can actually do many things while staying with our family or friend.</p>
		<p>Right now, i'm staying with my parent after the MCO is being issued. So my routine of everyday is just like my ordinary day.<br>
		Just that i'm not going any where beside staying indoor. For me, my time has been filled with playing mobile games such as Mobile Legend (ML),<br>
		Player Unknown BattleGround (PUBG), and many more. I'm also filled my time with watching movies and drama that is up to date from the social web such as Instagram and Facebook.<br>
		My day routine is just normal at day but it change at night. I always late going to sleep because I obsessed on playing game in the late night hours. That is why i'm always<br>
		going to bed late such as 3 to 4 a.m. and will getting up in 10 to 11 a.m. I afraid that this routine will endanger my body and mental health but this is all i can do in this MCO time.</p>

		<p>When UiTM posted that there will be online classes started 14th April 2020, I really hoping that i can change my routine back and need to control on playing games and watching movies while<br>
		focusing on my studies instead. this is because it was hard for any student to attend or learning from ODL because not every classes can manage to teach without any physical classes.<br>
		So everyday on weekday i filled my time with online classes and doing my assignment and i have reducing my time on playing mobile game.<br>
		Hopefully all of this pandemicc problem can be resolve quicly. In this time being, everyone need to stay at home and always stay safe.</p>
